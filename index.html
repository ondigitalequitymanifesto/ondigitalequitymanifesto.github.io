            <h2>The human experience is now inextricable from computing.</h2>

            <p>As life becomes increasingly tangled with technology, we must be vigilant in ensuring that individuals be provided equal access to this new and integral aspect of the human experience. This manifesto explores the idea that restricting access to the open internet in any capacity is comprable to a denial of any other core human right - these days, the right to technology is ever more important than before.</p>

        <h2 class="section-number one">1.</h2>
        <div class="section-content one">
            <h2>Education. Communication. Infrastructure.</h2>    
            <p>It is no longer plausible - nor is it wise - to deny the ubiquity and necessity of technology in contemporary life. Existence in the modern era is no longer able to be extricated from technology in any capacity - we are necessarily dependent on its benefits as we are crippled by its shortcomings. This is evident in a few core capacities and industries.</p>
            <p>As the modern workforce seeks a post-COVID norm, we see through the rise of remote labor and digital workspaces that workplace dynamics have become increasingly tangled with digital tools. The year-long quarantine that forced various companies to reexamine the mechanics behind workplace communication has served as a catalyst to kick start a new age of digital collaboration, in which irl-meetings become increasingly sparse and critical decisions are made over Slack messages and video calls. As such, technical literacy in both career-relevant and communication-oriented software is now a mandatory skill akin to basic speech. This highlights what we’ve already known since the advent of email - that for better or worse, work is reliant on both technological literacy as well as access to technology. </p>
            <p>Similarly, the 2020 pandemic has highlighted the educational capacities of technology, both in the sense that entire classrooms can be moved online as well the widespread availability of learning resources available for free, provided one has technical literacy to access and discover said materials. While this has brought along various challenges, it has demonstrated the efficacy of fully remote or hybridized learning environments. In conjunction with a general trend towards large repositories of educational content becoming readily available (various youtube channels, khan academy, etc.), it’s no longer possible to deny the role technology plays and will continue to play in education. </p>
            <p>But perhaps the most pervasive and fascinating example of technological entanglement with the fundamental human experience is the shift of casual communication towards the digital. Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and more are all examples of a rapidly developing social paradigm where our circles and networks have shifted into the digital realm. This has occurred to the extent that a significant portion of human social practices are entirely reliant or based off of activities conducted on these platforms. These platforms also serve as a form of centralized identification (most prevalently through the use of these platforms as viable authentication onto other services), further cementing their role in the modern human experience. </p>
            <p>More alarming is the increasing involvement of these social platforms within governing infrastructure. The integration of WeChat into a significant portion of China’s services is an example of this trend. In these cases, there are concerns to be addressed regarding techno-nationalist regulations and the part these platforms play within sovereign agendas, but that is considered to be out of the scope of this manifesto. For now, we are primarily concerned with the core idea that social media platforms can be integrated into governing infrastructures at all - implying that existence within the confines of a governing society is becoming increasingly entangled with the platforms built into the government.</p>
            <p>In these highlighted cases where technology is contextualized through the purposes of education, communication, social well-being, and even government infrastructure, we can see that civilization’s dependence on technology has progressed to the point where it can no longer be considered optional. Simply put, the human experience is now utterly inextricable from computing.</p>

        <h2 class="section-number two">2.</h2>
        <div class="section-content two">
            <h2>The Right to Technology</h2>    
            <p>If one accepts the previous assertion that technology is fundamentally tied to the modern human experience, then it becomes an infringement on human rights to partially prohibit or outright deny access to said technologies. Similarly, providing education or training on technological literacy is of equal importance, as denying access to technical literacy (in other words, education on technology and its use) is just another form of impeding access to technology. </p>
            <p>Since ‘human rights’ can be an ambiguous and broad topic to define outright and is open to contention, the purposes of this manifesto will be focused largely on technological equity: that is, providing equal access to the internet and technological tools as best possible. At the very least, providing access and literacy to technology will grant users the agency to live the full breadth of the modern human experience - to deny this access would be a violation against human rights. </p>
            <p>With this in mind, this manifesto will propose solutions addressing the concern of equitable access to technology. Although ubiquitous access to the internet won’t magically solve all the problems plaguing society, technology has the capacity to serve as a great equalizer through all of its various functions and should be distributed with this in mind. While access to the internet won’t be able to immediately close wealth inequalities, it grants career mobility in its capacity to educate (take, for example, the growth rate of developers due to the rise in bootcamps and the general availability of computer science materials on the internet). And while technology hasn’t been able to completely heal physical impairments or ailments without fault, assistive technologies such as screen readers, text-to-speech programs, and other accessibility-centered products grant those with immediate handicaps opportunities and capabilities that they otherwise would not have. </p>
            <p>While this is discussed solely in a speculative capacity, this manifesto believes that technology is neither good nor evil. A tool’s general capacity to do a broad range of work is correlated to its capacity to do good or evil, and as such advancements in technology won’t strictly guarantee an equitable future. </p>
            <p>As such, the body of actors relevant to this discussion have a moral responsibility to ensure as best they can that these tools be used for the betterment of society, in the pursuit towards a more equitable future through the proposals outlined in section five.</p>

        <h2 class="actor-title three">Government</h2>

        <p class="actor-content three">Governments on both a local, state, and national level have an obligation to, as best and reasonably as possible, provide citizens equal access to technology and still prevent themselves from using said technology to monitor private data. </p>


        <h2 class="actor-title four">Platform Owners</h2>

        <p class="actor-content four">This includes developers, designers, product leads, and anyone involved within the product lifecycle. These actors have a responsibility to produce products that act and perform towards the best interests of consumers.</p>
      
        <h2 class="actor-title five">Distributors & Guardians</h2>

        <p class="actor-content five">On a smaller level, distributors of technology (mostly device vendors) should make an effort to distribute technology without bias. Similarly, it is recommended that parents allow reasonable access to the internet when their children reach an appropriate age. </p>

        <div class="section-content six">
            <h2>A Proposal of Actions</h2>
            <p>Below is a loosely organized list of possible solutions to the concerns explored above. </p>

                <h3>General Restrictions on Technology</h3>
                <p>Governing bodies should not restrict access to technology in any capacity. This applies to both preventing distribution or access to devices (computers, phones, tablets, etc.) as well as policing content digitally (firewalls or any other methods of blocking content).</p>

                <h3>Oppressive Usage of Technology</h3>
                <p>Additionally, technological integrations into government infrastructures should be monitored and regulated to prevent said technologies from being used as a tool for oppression. Failsafes should be set such that platform owners cannot design and distribute content in a way that goes against public interest (technological backdoors, UI dark patterns, etc.). </p>

                <h3>Public Access to Technology</h3>
                <p>Public access to computers and the internet should be made as available as possible - whether this is through schools, libraries, community centers, or other means, it’s necessary for communities to provide equal access to technology platforms.</p>

                <h3>Personal Restrictions on Technology</h3>
                <p>While it is not our place to police how children are raised, the aforementioned access to public technology should be made available to those of a certain age. Any harsh restrictions on accessing basic technology in children can be viewed as an impediment on the development of technical literacy, which according to the logic of this manifesto would qualify as an impediment on human rights itself. </p>
